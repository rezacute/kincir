## 🎉 **Conclusion**

The integration test phase has been **successfully completed** with comprehensive coverage of:

1. **Cross-backend acknowledgment consistency** - All backends behave uniformly
2. **High-throughput scenarios** - Performance validated under load
3. **Router integration** - End-to-end message processing verified
4. **Error recovery** - Robust handling of edge cases
5. **Performance optimization** - Sub-millisecond acknowledgment times achieved

The Kincir project now has a **robust, well-tested acknowledgment system** that provides:
