# Security Policy

The Kincir team and community take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Kincir, please report it to us by emailing `security@example.com` (replace with a real dedicated email address if available, otherwise, specify to open a confidential issue if the platform supports it, or as a last resort, a regular issue with a clear "Security Vulnerability" title).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

You should include the following information in your report:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version of Kincir affected.
- Any potential impact you've identified.
- Your name and a way to contact you (optional, for acknowledgment).

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We will investigate the report and determine its validity and severity.
- We will keep you informed of our progress.
- We will publicly disclose the vulnerability once a fix is available, and credit you for the discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This policy applies to the latest released version of Kincir and any supported beta versions. Older versions should be updated to the latest release.

## Best Practices

While we strive to make Kincir secure, we also recommend users follow security best practices:
- Keep your Kincir version up-to-date.
- Secure your message broker infrastructure.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for applications using Kincir.

Thank you for helping keep Kincir secure!
