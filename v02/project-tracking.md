## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Ack/Nack Complexity**: Backend-specific acknowledgment semantics may be more complex than anticipated
   - **Mitigation**: Start with in-memory implementation, thorough research of backend behaviors
   - **Contingency**: Simplify initial implementation, defer advanced features

2. **Performance Targets**: May not meet aggressive performance targets
   - **Mitigation**: Early benchmarking, continuous profiling
   - **Contingency**: Adjust targets based on realistic measurements

3. **Test Stability**: Integration tests with external brokers may be flaky
   - **Mitigation**: Use containerized test environments, implement retry logic
   - **Contingency**: Focus on unit tests, simplify integration test scenarios

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Correlation ID Overhead**: Performance impact may be higher than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths
   - **Contingency**: Make correlation tracking optional

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes may break existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive compatibility testing
   - **Contingency**: Provide migration utilities
